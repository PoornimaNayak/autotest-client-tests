The GNOME Structured File Library  is a simple i/o library that can read and write common file types
                  and handle structured formats that provide file-system-in-a-file semantics. libgsf aims to provide an efficient extensible I/O abstraction
                  for dealing with different structured file formats.

The package provides:

/usr/bin/gsf-office-thumbnailer
/usr/lib64/libgsf-1.so.114
/usr/lib64/libgsf-1.so.114.0.26 

How to run the test:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/libgsf/
./libgsf.sh
