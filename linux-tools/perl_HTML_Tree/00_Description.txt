Description : This distribution contains a suite of modules for representing, creating, and extracting information from HTML syntax trees

HTML-Tree is a suite of Perl modules for making parse trees out of HTML source. It consists of mainly two modules, whose documentation you should refer to: HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element.

HTML::TreeBuilder is the module that builds the parse trees. (It uses HTML::Parser to do the work of breaking the HTML up into tokens.)

The tree that TreeBuilder builds for you is made up of objects of the class HTML::Element.
