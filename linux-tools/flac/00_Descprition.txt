FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Grossly oversimplified, FLAC
is similar to Ogg Vorbis, but lossless.

FLAC is comprised of
  * `libFLAC', a library which implements reference encoders and
    decoders for native FLAC and Ogg FLAC, and a metadata interface
  * `libFLAC++', a C++ object wrapper library around libFLAC
  * `flac', a command-line program for encoding and decoding files
  * `metaflac', a command-line program for viewing and editing FLAC
    metadata


The source has the following tests:

test_flac: A basic sanity testing of flac command by encoding/decoding for different formats
test_bin: A full regression of flac commands for each and every option with various formats  ( not including in my test)
test_grabbag:  tests to check grabbag_ APIs which is for getting and storing cuesheet and picture information in a track
test_libFLAC:  tests for FLAC C apis
test_libFLAC++:  tests for FLAC C++ apis
test_metaflac: tests metadata created for flac encoded files using metaflac command
test_seeking : test APIs  for track seeking , each and every point seeking in track is checked ( takes also around 2-3 hours) ( not including in my  test script
test_streams : test APIs for tracks streams , this test also takes around 2-3 hours ( not including in my test script)

How to run:
------------------------
./flac.sh
