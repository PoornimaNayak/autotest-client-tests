About:
libverto provides a way for libraries to expose asynchronous interfaces
without having to choose a particular event loop, offloading this
decision to the end application which consumes the library.

libverto exists to solve an important problem: many applications and libraries are unable to write asynchronous code because they are unable to pick an event loop.
This is particularly true of libraries who want to be useful to many applications who use loops that do not integrate with one another.

It has sub-packages which different modules for libverto.
example:
libverto-libevent - Module for libverto which provides integration with libevent.

How-to run the test
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/libverto
./libverto.sh
