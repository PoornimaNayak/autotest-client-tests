GStreamer is a development framework for creating applications like media players, video editors, streaming media broadcasters and so on. 
That said, very good media players can easily be built on top of GStreamer especially when using the high-level object called playbin.

GStreamer's development framework makes it possible to write any type of streaming multimedia application. The GStreamer framework is 
designed to make it easy to write applications that handle audio or video or both. It isn't restricted to audio and video, and can process
any kind of data flow. The pipeline design is made to have little overhead above what the applied filters induce. This makes GStreamer a
good framework for designing even high-end audio applications which put high demands on latency. 

How to run the test:
-------------------
./gstreamer.sh
