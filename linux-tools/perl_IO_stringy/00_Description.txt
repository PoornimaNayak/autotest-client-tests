Package Name: perl-IO-stringy

Summary     : I/O on in-core objects like strings and arrays for Perl

Description :
This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both traditional
and object-oriented I/O) on things *other* than normal filehandles; in
particular, IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, and IO::Lines.

In the more-traditional IO::Handle front, we have IO::AtomicFile, which
may be used to painlessly create files that are updated atomically.

And in the "this-may-prove-useful" corner, we have IO::Wrap, whose
exported wraphandle() function will clothe anything that's not a blessed
object in an IO::Handle-like wrapper... so you can just use OO syntax
and stop worrying about whether your function's caller handed you a
string, a globref, or a FileHandle.
