pygpgme - A Python module for working with OpenPGP messages

PyGPGME is a Python module that lets you sign, verify, encrypt and decrypt messages
using the OpenPGP format. It is built on top of GNU Privacy Guard and
the GPGME library. GPGME provides a high-level crypto API for
encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key.

How to run the tests:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/pygpgme
