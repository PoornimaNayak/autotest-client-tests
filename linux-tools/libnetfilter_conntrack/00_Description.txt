package Name : libnetfilter_conntrack
Description :
libnetfilter_conntrack is a userspace library providing a programming
interface (API) to the in-kernel connection tracking state table.

libnetfilter_conntrack - userspace library for the connection tracking system
= Connection Tracking System =

The connection tracking system is a in-kernel subsystem that stores information
about the state of a connection in a memory structure that contains the source
and destination IP addresses, port number pairs, protocol types, state, and
timeout. With this extra information, we can define more intelligent filtering
policies.

How to run test ?
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/libnetfilter_conntrack
run the script
./libnetfilter_conntrack.sh

To run test individually?
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/libnetfilter_conntrack/utils
./$tests

Note : The test has to run in order i.e after executig conntrack_create before calling conntrack_create_nat delete the first created conntrack i.e execute ./conntrack_delete .
similarly take care the order for other tests,refer the variable $TESTS in libnetfilter_conntrack.sh for the order in which tests  needs to be executed.
