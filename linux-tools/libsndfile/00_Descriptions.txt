Libsndfile is a library designed to allow the reading and writing of many different sampled sound file formats (such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format) through one standard library interface.
During read and write operations, formats are seamlessly converted between the format the application program has requested or supplied and the file's data format. 

How to run the test
-------------------
./libsndfile.sh
