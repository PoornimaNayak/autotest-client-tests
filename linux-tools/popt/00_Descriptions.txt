popt
	A command line parser library. Test is derived from self-test in the
	source tree. Note that popt is a sub-package of the rpm package.

how to run
	popt.sh

notes
	when input is "-T something -a more args"
	popt 1.6 output is "--arg2 something -- more args"
	popt 1.7 output is "--arg2 something more args"


The popt.sh overrides the "run" and "run_diff" methods of original testit.sh.
And sources it for running the different tests.

The patch to popt package should remove all the lines except the test
invocation lines from testit.sh.
