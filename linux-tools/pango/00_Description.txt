Pango is a library for laying out and rendering of text, with an emphasis on internationalization.
Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is needed, though most of the work on Pango so far has
been done in the context of the GTK+ widget toolkit. Pango forms the core of text and font handling
for GTK+-2.x

Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used
with different font backends.
