GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.
Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK+ is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites.

Steps for verifying the manual tests: 
 ---------------------------------------

1) Start vncserver on the test machine and run vncviewer from your machine by specifying the test machine IP and port number.
        on test machine :  
    vncserver
    New 'plm62:4 (root)' desktop is plm62:4
    plm62 machine ip : 9.182.176.62

    on local machine :
    vncviewer 9.182.176.62:4    
 
2) Open xterm on the X-window
    Right click -> xterm
     
3) cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/gtk2/manual-tests/

4) Execute the test binaries one by one. Each test on execution, opens a widget, on which certain operations has to be done and closed.

    $ ls /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/gtk2/manual-tests
    simple  stresstest-toolbar  testframe  testorientable  testspinbutton  testtext
a) Execute simple test 
    $ ./simple 
A widget containing a button named "hello world" appears on the screen.
Click the helloworld button and check if the helloworld text appears in the console for every click. 
Close the widget.

b) Execute stresstest-toolbar test
    $ ./stresstest-toolbar 
A widget flickers when the test is executed.
Widget gets closed automatically.

c) Execute testframe test
    $ ./testframe
A widget containing a frame named "Hello!" in the middle and four spinner boxes(x thickness, y thickness, x align, y align) appears on the screen. 
Using the 4 spinners, modify the thickness and aligment in x and y axis and check if the "Hello!" frame size is modified accordingly.
Close the widget.

d) Execute testorientable test
    $ ./testorientable
A widget containing a button named "Horizontal" at the top and 6 other buttons named "GtkBox" appears on the screen.
Click the "Horizontal" button and check if the 6 "GtkBox" buttons are arranged horizontally.
Now a button name "Vertical" will appear at the top.
Click the "Vertical" button and check if the 6 "GtkBox" buttons are arranged vertically.
Close the widget.

e) Execute testspinbutton test
    $ ./testspinbutton
A widget containing few spinner boxes appears on the screen.
Modify the value in the box by clicking the up and down spin buttons.
Close the widget.

f) Execute testtext test
    $ ./testtext
A text editor widget will appear on the screen.
Type some text on the text area and check if the text appears.
Check if the line numbers change whenever text goes to next line.
Click on the "File" menu at the top and try saving the document, opening a new document, exiting from the text editor.
Click on the "Edit" menu and try finding some keywords.
Click on the "Attributes" and try changing the attributes of the text like font, indentation, font size etc.
Close the widget.

Testing for gtk2 modules like libgail.
========================================

1) cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/gtk2/gail-tests

2) Export GTK_MODULES to module libgail.
   Set the environment variable GTK_MODULES to
   "libgail:lib<testname>"

   For example, for testactions, it would be "libgail:libtestactions"

3) Run the GTK+ test program specified.
	Example, 
   cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/gtk2/manual-tests
   ./testactions
