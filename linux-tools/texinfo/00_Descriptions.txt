Testcase for texinfo.

Texinfo is a software documentation system primarily designed for writing
software manuals
Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file
to produce both online information and printed output.

Sample texinfo file -
http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/21.5/html/texinfo_25.html

The command provided by this package is:

/usr/bin/makeinfo

make info is to translate Texinfo source documentation to various other
formats like html, Docbook XML, plain text etc. By default it will translate into Info
files suitable for reading online with Emacs or standalone GNU Info.
