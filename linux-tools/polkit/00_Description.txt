PolicyKit provides an authorization API intended to be used by
privileged programs ("MECHANISMS") offering service to unprivileged
programs ("CLIENTS") through some form of IPC mechanism such as D-Bus
or Unix pipes. In this scenario, the mechanism typically treats the
client as untrusted. For every request from a client, the mechanism
needs to determine if the request is authorized or if it should refuse
to service the client. Using the PolicyKit API, a mechanism can offload
this decision to a trusted party: The PolicyKit Authority.

In addition to acting as an authority, PolicyKit allows users to obtain
temporary authorization through authenticating either an administrative
user or the owner of the session the client belongs to.
