tcpdump	
	Test the functionality of tcpdump and libpcap.

	This test covers some commonly-used tcpdump options, 
and we think it's fine from FIV perspective.

Setup:

1) Add the IP  & hostname of your machine to /etc/hosts

cat >> /etc/hosts
10.124.111.70	test24.in.example.com  test24

2) Assuming eth0 as the network interface:
Invoke the test as below:

IF_NAME=eth0 ./tcpdump.sh
