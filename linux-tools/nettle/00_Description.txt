Testcase for nettle

Nettle is a low-level cryptographic library. Nettle is a cryptographic library
that is designed to fit easily in more or less any context:
In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++, Python, Pike, ...), in
applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel space.
As per the requirement of different applications, different cryptographic
alogorithms nd libs exist.
nettle provides a low-level crypto stuff, and providing a simple but general
interface to it.
one can build several application and context specific interfaces on top of
Nettle.

The features and support include:
- Hash Functions:
    -Cryptographic hash functions like SHA256, SHA224, SHA512, SHA3-224,
SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512
    -Other hash functions - MD5 , MD2,  MD4
    -nettle-hash-abstraction, cipher functions ( block cipher - AES,ARCTWO,
     stream cipher - ARCFOUR, BLOWFISH ) etc,  Generate random number with
Knuth's lagged fibonacci generator.

The package provides binaries and libraries .

The libraries include
/usr/lib*/libhogweed.so*
/usr/lib*/libnettle.so*

How to execute the test:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/nettle
Execute ./nettle.sh
