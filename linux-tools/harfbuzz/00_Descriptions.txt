Description:
------------
HarfBuzz is Persian translation of "OpenType". Originally there was this font format called TrueType.
People and companies started calling their type engines all things ending in Type: FreeType, CoolType,
ClearType, etc. And then came OpenType, which is the successor of TrueType. So, for OpenType
implementation, Its decided to stick with the concept but use the Persian translation. Which is fitting
given that Persian is written in the Arabic script, and OpenType is an extension of TrueType that adds
support for complex script rendering, and HarfBuzz is an implementation of OpenType complex text shaping.
