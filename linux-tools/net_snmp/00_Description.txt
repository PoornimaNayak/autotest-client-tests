TestCase        : net-snmp

Description     : Test net-snmp basic functions.

===============================================================================

* INTRODUCTION

This is testcase for the net-snmp package (version 5.3.0.1).


* RUN

Two modes are supported: local and remote.  In local mode, the daemon
and the client would run on same local machine, thus only one machine
is needed.  In remote mode, you've to use two machines, one for the
daemon and another for the client.  Remote mode is better because
there will be real network flow thus the test better resembles real
user environment.  For Auto FIV, local mode is enough.  The remote
mode is designed for stress test.

Local mode:
1. Install net-snmp-devel package.
2. Run ./net_snmp.sh.


Remote mode:

This testcase should be deployed on both machines.  The env variable
SNMP_TEST_HOST on client machine is used to designate the address (or
hostname) of the server machine.  And publickey ssh access
(passwordless) should be set between these two machines. To start
test, run ./net_snmp.sh on client machine.  For example:

$ SNMP_TEST_HOST=serverhost ./net_snmp.sh

Remember to install net-snmp-devel package.



* NOTES

These scripts mainly come from the net-snmp source package.  Testcase
needs some *.h files in the net-snmp-devel package to determine build
configurations.
