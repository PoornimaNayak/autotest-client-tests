nmap is a popular port scanning tool and security auditing tool in
Linux networking. In general, any port scanner tries to connect each
port upon a host,and then reports the results. For eg. a scanner can
connect to:
  port 1  - to check if tcpmux is running
  port 7  - to check if echo is running
  port 22 - to check if sshd is running
  etc

/etc/services is a good reference to know the complete mapping of ports
and the userspace programs. Depending upon the received response, the
ports are classified (open/close/blocked) and reported.

nmap can also additionally report:
  1. version of service if identifiable.
  2. version of operating system (through the variations in the way
     different network packets are handled).

nmap has been for debugging the system network for a long time and its
so many options assist us to select the way we like to scan the network.
But, from intgertaion testing point of view, it is suffcient to test
its interfaces such as,
  - port scanning (TCP connect/syn scan with OS version detection
    and a UDP port scan). Use -O -v for version detection. Check network
    distance ( 0 hops for localhost).
  - check ICMP ping scan.
  - check protocol scan and verify if the enabled protocols are matching
    the expected protocols.
  - check DNS resolution using list scan option. check if resolved ip is
    correct.
  - enable a installed service and verify if nmap can report it.
  - add a custom service (and block a tcp/udp port). verify if nmap can
    report it.
  - block a TCP port of an installed service in IP firewaall and verify
    if nmap reports accordingly.
