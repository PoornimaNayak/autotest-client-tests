Descirpton:
-----------
libxcb provides an interface to the X Window System protocol, which
replaces the current Xlib interface. It has several advantages over
Xlib, including:
- size: small, simple library, and lower memory footprint
- latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
- direct protocol access: interface and protocol correspond exactly
- proven thread support: transparently access XCB from multiple threads
- easy extension implementation: interfaces auto-generated from XML-XCB

Tests included:
--------------
check_all -- Tests the Public API of XCB provided by libxcb.

How to run:
-----------
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/libxcb
./libxcb.sh
