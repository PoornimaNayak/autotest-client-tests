The rpcbind utility is a server that converts RPC program
numbers into universal addresses. It must be running on the
host to be able to make RPC calls on a server on that machine.

The test starts a RPC server program and collects info
using rpcinfo command.

rpcinfo makes an RPC call to an RPC server and reports what it finds.

printmsg.x is written in RPCL and rpcgen is used to
generate the server and client side stubs and headers.

rpcgen printmsg.x generates below files:
printmsg_svc.c
printmsg_clnt.c
printmsg.h
