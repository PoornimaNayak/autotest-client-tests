FIV for KVM /  qemu-kvm
=======================

               Test covers 4 cases

               1) Kernel configuration required for KVM
               2) KVM Modules(if built as modules)
               3) KVM Runtime tests. ( /dev/kvm attributes)
               4) Qemu KVM files

               Note: The kvm-modules package is built separately out of the
               kernel-source. Hence, the kvm, kvm-intel, kvm-amd
               configs may not appear in the kernel config file installed.
               So, we first check if the modules are installed.

The test is a bit tricky since, the kvm-modules may ship the modules out of the kernel tree.
In that case, the kernel config may not have any info about the KVM modules.
So we first check to find if there are kvm modules on the system. (This is not a test, but a subtest).

If we find the modules, we do not bother about the config options for these features. But other config options are verified.
