About:
ibassuan is a small library implementing the so-called Assuan protocol.
This protocol is used for IPC between most newer GnuPG components. Both, server and client side functions are provided.
Assuan's primary use is to allow a client to interact with a non-persistent server. Using Assuan,
this is accomplished by forking a subprocess and communicating with it via,
for example, a pipe or unix domain socket. This method is neither elegant nor efficient especially
when there is a lot of data spread across several transactions,
also a significant amount of data is memcpy-ed from the client to a file descriptor and from the file descriptor to the server.
This type of client/server communication can be useful: the client is completely separate from the server; they are in different address spaces.
This is especially important in situations where the server must have a known degree of reliability and data must be protected

How to run the test:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/libassuan
./libassuan.sh
