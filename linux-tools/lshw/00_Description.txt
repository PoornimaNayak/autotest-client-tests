Description : 

lshw is a small tool to extract detailed information on the hardware
configuration of the machine. It can report exact memory configuration,
firmware version, mainboard configuration, CPU version and speed, cache
configuration, bus speed, etc. It does so by reading
different files in the /proc directory. 

The lshw command needs to run with super privileges to be able to
detect and report the maximum amount of information. So run as root,
or use sudo.
