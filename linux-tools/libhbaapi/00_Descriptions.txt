The libhbaapi library is the Host Bus Adapter (HBA) API library for
Fibre Channel and Storage Area Network (SAN) resources. It contains a
unified API that programmers can use to access, query, observe and
modify SAN and Fibre Channel services

libhbaapi covers the following tests:
1) Test the functionality of different hba api's using hbaapitest file
provided by the package

Note:This test needs HBA card. As libhbaapi package is intended for testing vendor specific hba api's. So the testcase is
using ixgbe kernel module as a driver.

hbaapitest testcase will read the details of qlogic driver from /etc/hba.conf
and prints all the information on connected adapter and its attributes.

HOW TO RUN:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/libhbaapi
./libhbaapi.sh
