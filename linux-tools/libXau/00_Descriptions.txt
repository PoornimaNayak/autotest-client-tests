Description: The libXau package contains a library implementing the X11
Authorization Protocol. It uses existing core protocol and library hooks 
for specifying authorization data in the connection setup block to restrict
use of the display to only those clients that show that they know a 
server-specific key called a "magic cookie".

The working scheme involved in a X11 session involves the following parts --

    o  xdm
        -  generate random magic cookie and store in protected file
        -  pass name of magic cookie file to server
        -  when user logs in, add magic cookie to user's auth file
        -  when user logs out, generate a new cookie for server

    o  server
        -  check client authorization data against magic cookie
        -  read in cookie whenever the server resets
        -  do not add local machine to host list if magic cookie given

    o  Xlib
        -  read in authorization data from file
        -  find data for appropriate server
        -  send authorization data if found

    o  xauth
        -  add entries to user's auth file
        -  remove entries from user's auth file

From the above parts, this package does the xauth part .
