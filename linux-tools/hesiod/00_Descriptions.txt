Hesiod is a simple lookup service for information that changes infrequently,
like passwd, hosts, protocols etc. Hesiod service is built on top of DNS to
serve the lookup requests using "name" and "type" as pair of strings. You
can use hesiod's userspace tool itself to look up for eg,

   hesiod root passwd

root is name and passwd is type. But, our package does not ship userspace tool
as hesiod is popularly used in NSS (Name Service Switch) facility in your
system. For more info about nss, you can check /etc/nssswitch.conf. So,
once you enable passwd look up using hesiod for instance, you can run glibc's
userspace tool:

  genent root passwd

This should return  /etc/passwd entry for root account. In fivextra, we have
one test from its source called "hestest" to test libhesiod.so.0. and one to
test passwd lookup integration using NSS which is an usecase of this library.

To run the tests, execute "./hesiod.sh".
