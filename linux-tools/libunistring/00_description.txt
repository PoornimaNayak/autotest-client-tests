This portable C library implements Unicode string types in three flavours:
(UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32), together with functions for character processing
(names, classifications, properties) and functions for string processing
(iteration, formatted output, width, word breaks, line breaks, normalization,
case folding and regular expressions).

Text files are nowadays usually encoded in Unicode, and may consist of very
different scripts – from Latin letters to Chinese Hanzi –, with many kinds of
special characters.
This library provides functions for manipulating Unicode strings and for
manipulating C strings according to the Unicode standard.

This library consists of the following parts:
<unistr.h> elementary string functions
<uniconv.h> conversion from/to legacy encodings
<unistdio.h> formatted output to strings
<uniname.h> character names
<unictype.h> character classification and properties
<uniwidth.h> string width when using nonproportional fonts
<uniwbrk.h> word breaks
<unilbrk.h> line breaking algorithm
<uninorm.h> normalization (composition and decomposition)
<unicase.h> case folding
<uniregex.h> regular expressions (not yet implemented)

How to run the test:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/libunistring
Execute ./libunistring.sh
