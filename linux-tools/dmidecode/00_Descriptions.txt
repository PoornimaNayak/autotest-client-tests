IBM CSDL testsuite for dmidecode
------------------------------------
Refer to the README file of the sourcecode, CSDL add this dmidecode_test.sh to
test the dmidecode biosdecode vpddecode.
"ownership" seems to be no result in common machine, so we just skipped it.

Before run the dmidecode_test.sh:
1. Be root user
2. already install the dmidecode package on x86/ia64, testcase will bypass on
other architecture.
