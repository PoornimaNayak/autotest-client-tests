DBIx::Simple provides a simplified interface to DBI, Perl's powerful
database module.

DBIx::Simple has basic support for returning results as objects. The actual construction method has to be provided
 by the chosen class.

The DBI is a database access module for the Perl programming language. It defines a set of methods, variables, and conventions that provide a consistent database interface, independent of the actual database being used.

It is important to remember that the DBI is just an interface. The DBI is a layer of "glue" between an application and one or more database driver modules. It is the driver modules which do most of the real work. The DBI provides a standard interface and framework for the drivers to operate within.
