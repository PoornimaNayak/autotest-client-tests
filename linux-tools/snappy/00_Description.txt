Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum
compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead,
it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance,
compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster
for most inputs
How to run the test:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/snappy
Execute ./snappy.sh
