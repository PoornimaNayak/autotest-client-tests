Avahi : avahi is a service auto-discovery package . It allows programs to
publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network with no
specific configuration. For example if are connected to a LAN network , then
avahi can help you to find printers, shared files or irc clients etc. 
avahi runs mDNS (multicast DNS) plus DNS-SD ( DNS service discovery ).

In Multicast DNS, each equipped host stores its own DNS records. It uses the
DNS programming interfaces, packet formats and operating, without configuring
a conventional DNS server .A multicast address is used by clients
wishing to get the IP address of a given hostname, and that host responds to
the client request with its IP address.
mDNS is useful for small networks without a DNS server.

DNS-SD uses the same technology, but in addition to regular DNS information,
hosts also publish service instance information: they announce what services 
they provide and how to contact those services. All of this is intended
to mean that hosts and services can connect to one another without requiring
any user configuration: known as Zeroconf sharing.
