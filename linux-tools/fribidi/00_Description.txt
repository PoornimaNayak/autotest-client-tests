Description:

Description:
FriBidi package is an implementation of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm
(BIDI). This is useful for supporting Arabic and Hebrew alphabets in other
packages.
This is a library to handle bidirectional scripts (for example Hebrew,
Arabic), so that the display is done in the proper way; while the text data
itself is always written in logical order.

This library will stimulate the implementation of Hebrew and Arabic in lots of
free software. Here is a small list of projects that would benefit from the
use of the GNU FriBidi library, but of course there are many more: Wine,
Mozilla, Qt, KDE, lynx, OpenOffice.

Utilities provided by package:

fribidi : is a command-line interface to the libfribidi library and can be
used to convert a logical string to visual output.
libfribidi.so : contains functions used to implement the Unicode Bidirectional
Algorithm.
