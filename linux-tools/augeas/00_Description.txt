Augeas is a library and command line tool used for handling Linux configurations management programmatically.
Augeas uses programs called lenses to map the filesystem to an XML tree which can then be parsed using an XPath syntax, using a bidirectional transformation.

How it works:
------------------
1. Augeas parses configuration files in their native formats and transforms them into a tree.
2. Configuration changes are made by manipulating this tree and saving it back into native config files.

Augeas package provides 3 binaries:
/usr/bin/augparse
/usr/bin/augtool
/usr/bin/fadot
