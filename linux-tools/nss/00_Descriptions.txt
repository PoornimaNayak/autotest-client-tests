Network Security Services (nss) package is a set of libraries and
utilities to enable cross platform secure server/client communication.
Tests available in source exercise nss-tools binaries, which implicitly
tests nspr (netscape portable runtime libraries) and sqlite database
as its certificate db. Hence, we can have them running as FIV.

To run FIV tests:
   ./nss.sh
   ./nss-sysinit.sh
