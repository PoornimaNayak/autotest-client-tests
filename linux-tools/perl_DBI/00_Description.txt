DBI - Database independent interface for Perl
DBI Perl Module is designed to allow the use of SQl and mySQL queries, available on most platforms, including SQL Server, DB2, Oracle and MySQL.
It defines a set of methods, variables, and conventions that provide a consistent database interface, independent of the actual database being used.This module allows the connection from a Perl script to different databases, using the appropriate database driver (DBD).
The DBI is a layer of "glue" between an application and one or more database driver modules
