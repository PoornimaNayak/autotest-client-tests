PyGTK is a set of bindings to the GTK+ user interface toolkit for the Python
language.

Python is an interpreted language with a very clean syntax, high-level data
structures, dynamic typing, object oriented characteristics and generally
acceptable performance. 

GTK+ is a graphical user interface toolkit, which includes user interface
components and a framework for handling events that are produced upon these
components.

A binding is code (usually a library) that allows  to access functions that
were coded in another language. In our case, GTK+ was written in C, and
applications written in C can use native GTK+. For a Python program to be able
to create applications using the GTK+ framework, a special library has to be
used. This library is PyGTK.
