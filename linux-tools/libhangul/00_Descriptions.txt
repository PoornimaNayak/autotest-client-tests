libhangul provides common features for Hangul input method programs.

This library implements Hangul keyboard input with various types of Korean keyboards.
 It is intended to be a base library of Korean input methods on multiple platforms.
This package contains the shared library and the runtime data. 

Functionality of the tests:
  inserts some symbols (~E~H) when a syllabale is not started with a consonant,
  append the symbol when a syllable is not ended with vowel,
  tries to remove the symbol when it is automatically inserted
and also checks to see if such syllable exist.

In Korean: Ja (Consonants) and Mo (Vowels)).

Basically the test checks to see if the assembled syllable is present in the table (Korean table).


How to run the test:
--------------------
./libhangul.sh
