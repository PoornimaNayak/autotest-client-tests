Descirpton: 
----------- 
libsemanage provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies. 
It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well as 
by programs such as load_policy, which must perform specific transformations 
on binary policies (for example, customizing policy boolean settings). 
 
Tests included: 
-------------- 
-test_semanage_store 
-test_utilities 
 
But "libsemanage-tests" is a wrapper which implicitly runs the above two tests. 
 
How to run: 
----------- 
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/libsemanage/tests 
./libsemanage-tests
