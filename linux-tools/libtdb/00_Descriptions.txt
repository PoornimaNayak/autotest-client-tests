libtdb is a simple database API. It was inspired by the realisation that in
Samba we have several ad-hoc bits of code that essentially implement small
databases for sharing structures between parts of Samba.

The interface is based on gdbm. tdbtest performs operations on most of tdb
api and compare with gdbm part. tdbtool is provided for simple database
manipulation on commandline (not installed by actual libtdb package).

libtdb.sh:
  - testsuite to trigger libtdb tests
