[RFC] testcases for udisks package

udisks provides a daemon, D-Bus API and command line tools for managing
disks and storage devices. It just acts as an enumeration on these block
devices so that, any applications can access the org.freedesktop.UDisks
service on the system message bus. Some operations (such as formatting
disks etc.) are restricted using PolicyKit.

udisks source has built-in tests which is written to test built binary
or the one installed in the system. Hence, these tests can be run to
check the package integration.

To run FIV tests: ./udisks.sh

Regarding customer on this package, it is used by RSS (Retail Store
Solutions) which provides OS for Point of Sale (POS) hardware (known as
IBM 4690 operating system).

The package tests can also be expanded to cover usecases particularly
on its data storage management (so that, this package could be helping
along with gnome-disk-utility which is available in mash), but not
yet implemented at this time.
