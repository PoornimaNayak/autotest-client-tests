Package Name : mcelog 

Description:

mcelog is the user space backend for logging machine check errors
reported by the hardware to the kernel. The kernel does the immediate
actions (like killing processes etc.) and mcelog decodes the errors
and manages various other advanced error responses like
offlining memory, CPUs or triggering events. In addition
mcelog also handles corrected errors, by logging and accounting them.
