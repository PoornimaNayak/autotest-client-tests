virt-what is a shell script which can be used to detect if the program
is running in a virtual machine.

The program prints out a list of "facts" about the virtual machine,
derived from heuristics.  One fact is printed per line.

If nothing is printed and the script exits with code 0 (no error),
then it can mean either that the program is running on bare-metal or
the program is running inside a type of virtual machine which we don't
know about or can't detect.

Current types of virtualization detected:

 - hyperv       Microsoft Hyper-V
 - kvm          Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM)
 - openvz       OpenVZ or Virtuozzo
 - powervm_lx86 IBM PowerVM Lx86 Linux/x86 emulator
 - qemu         QEMU (unaccelerated)
 - uml          User-Mode Linux (UML)
 - virtage      Hitachi Virtualization Manager (HVM) Virtage LPAR
 - virtualbox   VirtualBox
 - virtualpc    Microsoft VirtualPC
 - vmware       VMware
 - xen          Xen
 - xen-dom0     Xen dom0 (privileged domain)
 - xen-domU     Xen domU (paravirtualized guest domain)
 - xen-hvm      Xen guest fully virtualized (HVM)

How to run the test:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/virt-what
Execute ./virt-what.sh
