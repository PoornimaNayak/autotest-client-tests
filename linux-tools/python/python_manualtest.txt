Assumptions:
	1. You have all python-*.rpm installed in your SUT

	2.  This manual test takes advantage of some python programs from
            python-tools. If python-tools is not installed it can be downloaded
            from the package repository and installed with yum, rpm,
            rpm2cpio, etc.

	3. Configure your X server correctly, as python-tk should be run under
           X.

Instructions:
	This manual test verifies python-tk/python-curses/python-idle, since
        they cannot be covered by FIV-automation.

	A>. python-tk
	  1. From /usr/lib[64]/python2.6/lib-tk: run Dialog.py, FileDialog.py,
             Tkdnd.py, Tkinter.py etc
             e.g. "python Tkinter.py" will give you a sample demo of tk program.

          2. Install python-tools. Change directory to
             /usr/lib[64]/python2.6/Demo/tkinter/ and run some of the sample
             tests:
             e.g. "python guido/solitaire.py" will show you the traditional
             solitaire card game, //enjoy. Also run: AttrDialog.py,
             ShellWindow.py, newmenubardemo.py
		( Note: brownian.py and other tests that use tcl threads will
                  fail. Refer Bug #64566. OS has disabled threads in the tcl
                  package, due to its incompatibility with using fork() in tcl
                  scripts.)
	     The matt directory /usr/lib*/python2.6/Demo/tkinter/matt, provided
             by python-tools, will show you some more tk widgets that are
             invoked by python; try several of these.

	B>. python-curses
          1. Invoke test_curses from LTP FIV extra automated testcase directory,
          e.g.  cd /usr/lib64/python2.6/test
                ./regrtest.py -u curses test_curses

		This test should be run from shell prompt, as it's tty
		related, run from pythontest.sh will fail.  After the
		test, the console would become abnormal and needs to
		be reset manually (input "reset", then press Ctrl-J),
		this is normal.

		2. There are some other tests in python-tools for curses:
			cd /usr/lib*/python2.6/Demo/curses/
			run life.py, rain.py, tclock.py, xmas.py etc	

	C>. idle provided by python-tools.  This test requires that the tkinter
            rpm is installed. Use the "test.py" provided in test case directory.
          1. startx

          2. change directory to where test files test.py/module.py reside,

          3. start python-idle and open testfile
		   idle test.py

          4. Once 'idle test.py' is run a window titled "Python Shell"
             should open. From the "Debug" menu select "Debugger". A window
             titled "Debug Control" should open.

          5. Next from the "Python Shell" window, click on the "Windows" menu
             and select "test.py"; a window titled "test.py" should open.

          6. In the "test.py" window, click on the "Run" menu and select
             "Run Module"; the "Debug Control" windows show come forward and
             have focus.

          7. Click the "Go" button, in the "Debug Control" window. The
             output from the test.py script should display in the "Python Shell"
             window. The last line of output should be:
    {'Y': [1, 2, (2, 99)], 'X': [1, 2, (2, 99), 1, 2, (2, 99)], 'Z': (2, 99)}

Notes:
	"python-tools" is not a functional package of OS, we treat it as an "implict test".
