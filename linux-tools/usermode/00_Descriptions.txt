usermode contains the consolehelper and userhelper program, which can be
used to allow configured programs to be run with superuser privileges by
ordinary users, and several graphical tools for users.

userhelper is a helper interface to PAM. This  program  provides a basic interface to change a userâ€™s password, gecos information, and shell.

userhelper covers the following tests:
1. Change user password using userhelper which is equivalent to passwd command
2. Change Gecos information using userhelper which is equivalent to chfn command
3. Change shell using userhelper which is equivalent to chsh command
4. Pass invalid shell to userhelper and check whether it returns correct error code or not
5. Pass invalid user to userhelper and check whether it returns correct error code or not
6. Execute userhelper as a normal user

Note:
	/usr/sbin/userhelper should be root setuid, (chmod u+s)

HOW TO RUN:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/usermode
./userhelper.sh
