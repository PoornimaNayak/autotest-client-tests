Description:
The Time::HiRes module implements a Perl interface to the usleep,
nanosleep,ualarm, gettimeofday, and setitimer/getitimer system calls, in other
words,high resolution time and timers.

In some cases, you may need to measure time in high-resolution, for example,
microsecond resolution as provided by gettimeofday() system call. In order to
use microsecond-resolution time in Perl, you can use Time::HiRes Perl module
which provides gettimeofday() microsecond-resolution timer function.

The module also provides usleep and ualarm functions, which are alternate
versions of the standard Perl sleep and alarm functions that understand
granularities of microseconds instead of just seconds.They take arguments in
microseconds; alternatively, you can import the module's sleep and alarm
functions, which take floating-point arguments in seconds.
