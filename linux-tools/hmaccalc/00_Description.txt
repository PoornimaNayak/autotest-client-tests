The hmaccalc package contains tools to calculate HMAC (Hash-based Message
Authentication Code) values for files.
The names and interfaces were designed to mimic those of the sha1sum,
sha256sum, sha384sum and sha512sum tools
 provided by the coreutils package.

binaries provided by this package includes:
/usr/bin/sha1hmac
/usr/bin/sha256hmac
/usr/bin/sha384hmac
/usr/bin/sha512hmac

Functionality of these binaries to compute and/or verify HMAC and unkeyed
checksum values for the contents of files.
Reference: http://linux.die.net/man/8/sha256hmac

Example: Compute HMAC and verify:
================

Compute HMAC with key

#sha384hmac -K abcd  /etc/hosts
1af9e2384358225d9a0ad72e929c990d381eaba1ff587757a49edc23255b492be4dcc20807f098ab0b039aaccf9dbce1
/etc/hosts

Put this format output in a file :
#cat out
1af9e2384358225d9a0ad72e929c990d381eaba1ff587757a49edc23255b492be4dcc20807f098ab0b039aaccf9dbce1
/etc/hosts

Now verify the HMAC,

#sha384hmac -K abcd -c out
/etc/hosts: OK 

How to execute the test:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/hmaccalc/test
Execute ./hmaccalc.sh
