libXtst: This extension is a minimal set of client and server extensions required to completely test the X11 server with no user intervention.

* The functions provided by this extension fall into two groups:

  i)  Client Operations

    These routines manipulate otherwise hidden client-side behavior. The actual implementation will depend on the details of the actual
    language binding and what degree of request buffering, GContext caching, and so on, is provided. In the C binding, defined in section 7,
    routines are provided to access the internals of two opaque data structures - GCs and Visuals - and to discard any requests pending within
    the output buffer of a connection. The exact details can be expected to differ for other language bindings.

  ii) Server Requests

    The first of these requests is similar to that provided in most extensions: it allows a client to specify a major and minor version number
    to the server and for the server to respond with major and minor versions of its own. The remaining two requests allow the following:

        Access to an otherwise "write-only" server resource: the cursor associated with a given window

        Perhaps most importantly, limited synthesis of input device events, almost as if a cooperative user had moved the pointing device or pressed a key or button.

* The Record extension allows X clients to synthesise input events, which is useful for automated testing.
