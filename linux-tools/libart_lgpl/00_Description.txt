Libart is a 2D drawing library: its goal is to be a high-quality
vector-based 2D library with antialiasing and alpha composition. Libart
was developed by Raph Levien in an attempt to provide a powerful yet
easy-to-use foundation layer for the development of Gui-based
applications in Gnome. Libart is thus distributed as a part of Gnome
under the LGPL.

Libart_lgpl thus provides the Graphics routines used by the GnomeCanvas
widget and some other applications.
