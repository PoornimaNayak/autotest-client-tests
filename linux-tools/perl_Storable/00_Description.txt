Description:
The Storable extension brings persistence to your data.

You may recursively store to disk any data structure, no matter how
complex and circular it is, provided it contains only SCALAR, ARRAY,
HASH (possibly tied) and references (possibly blessed) to those items.

At a later stage, or in another program, you may retrieve data from
the stored file and recreate the same hiearchy in memory. If you
had blessed references, the retrieved references are blessed into
the same package, so you must make sure you have access to the
same perl class than the one used to create the relevant objects.

For more details refer to http://search.cpan.org/~ram/Storable-1.0.14/Storable.pm


How to run the test:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/perl-Storable
./perl-Storable.sh
