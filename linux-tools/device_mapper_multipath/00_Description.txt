TESTS
===========

3) Create a device with --notable
4) Loading a table for a device
5) Suspending a device
6) Resuming a device
7) Remove All

And most important :

8) Snapshot facility.


Here is the testcase for snapshot:

1.    Create a filesystem on disk0 and create a test file.
2.    Now create a snapshot for disk0 with disk1 as a COW device
3.    Mount the new dm device and Update the above test file
4.    Unmount the filesystem and verify that the test file is unchanged on the disk0


Implicitly tested options :

1) dmsetup info
2) dmsetup table


Untested : commands

* status (same as info)
* ls ( similar to info )
* reload table
* clear table
* targets - ( Lists the targets supported. Like, snapshot, linear, striped etc)
* deps - ( shows the dependency of the device. this info comes in "table"
command)
