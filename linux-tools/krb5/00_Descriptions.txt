In this test, we rely on a separate KDC server established up front.
Please refer to the document "krb5_server_setup.txt" for KDC server setup.

krb5-workstation
	Test a couple of kerberized services/clients and utilities, 
	including telnetd, ftpd, kshd, klogind
		ksu, rlogin, telnet, rsh, rcp, ftp
		kadmin, kinit, klist, kpasswd, ktutil, kvno ..

Usage: KDC_SERVER="test0" ./krb5-workstation.sh

Note:
	1. krb5-libs is implicitly tested.
	2. ksu should be root setuid, (chmod u+s),
	   otherwise, ksu from a non-root user will fail.

	krb5-devel:
		header and library for development, will not test

	krb5-server: 
		server may not included if included, implicit tested by serve setup 
		and conresponding client testcases

	krb5-client:
		client utilities tested in krb5.sh
		kinit, klist, kpasswd, kvno, sim_client, sclient(sample client), kadmin, ktutil

	krb5-apps-servers:
