Digest - Modules that calculate message digests

synopsis:
  $md5  = Digest->new("MD5");
  $sha1 = Digest->new("SHA-1");
  $sha256 = Digest->new("SHA-256");
  $sha384 = Digest->new("SHA-384");
  $sha512 = Digest->new("SHA-512");


Description:
========
The Digest:: modules calculate digests, also called "fingerprints" or
"hashes", of some data, called a message. The digest is (usually) some
small/fixed size string. The actual size of the digest depend of the algorithm
used. The message is simply a sequence of arbitrary bytes or bits.

An important property of the digest algorithms is that the digest is likely to
change if the message change in some way. Another property is that digest
functions are one-way functions, that is it should be hard to find a message
that correspond to some given digest. Algorithms differ in how "likely" and
how "hard", as well as how efficient they are to compute.


Usage:
To run all tests:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/perl-Digest
./perl-Digest.sh

To run test individually:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/perl-Digest
perl t/*.t
