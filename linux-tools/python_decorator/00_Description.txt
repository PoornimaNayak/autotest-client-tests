Description:Python decorators are an interesting example of why syntactic
sugar matters. In principle, their introduction in Python 2.4 changed nothing,
since they do not provide any new functionality which was not already present
in the language. In practice, their introduction has significantly changed the
way we structure our programs in Python.

How to run the test:
------------------------
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/python-decorator
./python-decorator.sh
