Package: gdisk

Description:
------------
An fdisk-like partitioning tool for GPT disks. GPT fdisk features a
command-line interface, fairly direct manipulation of partition table
structures, recovery tools to help you deal with corrupt partition
tables, and the ability to convert MBR disks to GPT format.

- gdisk -- This program is modeled after Linux fdisk, but it operates on GUID
  Partition Table (GPT) disks rather than the Master Boot Record (MBR) disks
that fdisk
  modifies. As such, gdisk is an interactive text-mode tool for manipulating
partitions, but it does nothing to the contents of those partitions (usually
filesystems, but
  sometimes swap space or other  data).

- cgdisk -- This program is modeled after Linux cfdisk, but it operates on GPT
  disks rather than the MBR disks that cfdisk modifies. As such, cgdisk is a
curses-based 
  text-mode tool for manipulating partitions, which is to say that it uses an
interface that relies on arrow keys and a dynamic display rather than the
command letters and a
  scrolling display like gdisk uses.

- sgdisk -- This program is conceptually similar to the Linux sfdisk and
  FreeBSD gpt programs, but its operational details differ. It enables
manipulation of GPT disks using
  command-line options, so it's suitable for use in scripts or by experts to
perform specific tasks that might take several commands in gdisk to
accomplish.

- fixparts -- This program, unlike the preceding three, operates on MBR disks.
  It's intended to fix certain problems that can be created by various
utilities. Specifically,
  it can fix mis-sized extended partitions and primary partitions located in
the middle of extended partitions. It also enables changing primary vs.
logical partition status
  (within limits  of what's legal in the MBR scheme) and making a few other
minor changes.It does NOT support creating new partitions; for that, you
should use
  fdisk, parted, or some other tool.

Usage:
