Note:
About prelink:
-------------

prelink is a program that modifies ELF shared libraries and
ELF dynamically linked binaries in such a way that the time
needed for the dynamic linker to perform relocations at
startup significantly decreases. Due to fewer relocations,
the run-time memory consumption decreases as well.
The prelinking information is only used at startup time
if none of the dependent libraries have changed since prelinking;
otherwise programs are relocated normally.

prelink first collects ELF binaries to be prelinked and
all the ELF shared libraries they depend on.
Then it assigns a unique virtual address space slot
to each library and relinks the shared library to that base address.
